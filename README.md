# XPSC Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to problems solved as part of the **Xettabyte Programming Club (XPSC)**. The problems are organized weekly and by day, following the structure provided by our instructors. Each week, we tackle at least 21 problems, distributed across daily goals. This repository documents my journey of consistent problem-solving and growth as a competitive programmer.
